# Amazon Product Co-Purchasing Network Analysis
This project presents a system for analyzing and recommending Amazon products, leveraging a dataset of over half a million reviews and metadata. It utilizes network analysis to understand product relationships, focusing on centrality metrics within the DVD category. The system includes regression models to predict product sales ranks and uses ego graph-based methods for product recommendation, ranking items based on user reviews and ratings. Although it explores community detection concepts, computational limitations restrict their implementation. It gives data-driven insights into customer purchasing patterns and product positioning in the Amazon marketplace.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to analyze vast and complex dataset of Amazon and understand the nuances of consumer behavior and product relationships. The project provided an opportunity to apply network analysis techniques in a real-world context and leverage network theory and data analytics to create a graph-based recommendation system based on user behavior.

## Data
[Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection] (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon-meta.html)

The dataset includes 548,552 different product reviews and product metadata (Books, music CDs, DVDs, and VHS video tapes).
